Part 1
COMMAND SYNTAX OPTIONS
In the computer world, the syntax of a command refers to the rules in which the command must be run in order for a piece of software to understand it. For example, a command's syntax may dictate case-sensitivity and what kinds of options are available that make the command operate in different ways.
Using the same key in a different way by means of the shift key would also be another example.

OPERATING SYSTEM
Linux is a Unix-like, open source and community-developed operating system (OS) for computers, servers, mainframes, mobile devices and embedded devices.  A Linux distribution -- often shortened to "Linux distro" -- is a version of the open source Linux operating system that is packaged with other components, such as an installation programs, management tools and additional software such as the KVM hypervisor.  Linux distributions offer choice, which can be messy, but also very useful. Anyone can make their own distribution by assembling it from the source code themselves, or even taking an existing distribution and modifying it â€“ that's why there are so many Linux distributions.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
JavaScript is another programming language.  To sum it up, the main reason why there are many programming languages out there is that different problems require different tools to solve them. Each programming language has certain features and characteristics that make it suitable for specific tasks.  Although programming languages are not usually designed for specific industries, it's clear that major industries have their preferences for coding languages to use. It makes sense, given how each industry has its own requirements and technological demands.

I want learn the cybersecurity necessities for use in the real the world.  When I am finished with this bootcamp, I would like to find a good job within the field of cybersecurity and apply what I've been taught to further my career.  I am very excited to learn everything that I can, even such as the simplest measures to keep my personal security tight.  That being said, I can't wait to apply it all on a larger scale.
